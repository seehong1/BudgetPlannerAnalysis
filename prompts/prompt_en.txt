Please perform a detailed financial analysis based on the provided household money manager data. First, analyze this month's data independently, then provide a comparison between this month and last month.

This Month's budget planner Data: {df_this_month}
This Month's Summary: {current_month_summary}

Last Month's budget planner Data: {df_last_month}
Last Month's Summary: {last_month_summary}

Part 1: {this_month_display} Analysis
Based on the {this_month_display} budget planner Summary provided:

Summarize the overall spending pattern and major income sources for this month.
Identify and list the top 3-5 highest expense categories (e.g., Groceries, Restaurants, Utilities) along with their approximate amounts.
Note any unusually large or one-time transactions.
Calculate and state the total amount saved for your individual accounts (Roth IRA, HYSA only) for this month.
Calculate and state your Final Net Balance for this month. This Final Net Balance should be calculated by subtracting both your Total Expenses and your Total Savings (including both individual savings and retirement account savings) from your Total Income. That is, Final Net Balance = Total Income - (Total Expenses + Total Savings from individual accounts + Total Savings from retirement accounts). Emphasize that this figure represents the final unallocated balance after all income has been spent or saved, and ideally, it should be close to zero.
Provide 2-3 key insights or observations specific to this month's financial activity.
